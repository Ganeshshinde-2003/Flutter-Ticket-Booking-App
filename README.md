# ✈️ Flight Ticket Booking App (UI Prototype)

A visually appealing flight ticket booking app UI prototype built using Flutter. This prototype showcases the UI design for the app's various screens. Please note that this version does not have interactive functionality for searching or booking flights. The app consists of four screens, each displaying a user-friendly interface for easy navigation and a seamless booking experience.

## Screens 📱

1. 🏠 Home Screen: Provides a quick overview of featured flights, promotions, and popular destinations.
2. 🔍 Search Screen: Placeholder screen for future search functionality.
3. 🎫 Tickets Screen: Displays booked tickets and reservation details (simulated data).
4. 👤 Profile Screen: Allows users to manage their personal information and view booking history.
